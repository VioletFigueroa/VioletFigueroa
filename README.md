## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **CompTIA Security+ certified cybersecurity analyst** combining hands-on technical expertise with a passion for making security accessible and sustainable. I specialize in **incident response, digital forensics, and vulnerability management** with proven results across diverse environments.

**What I Do:**
- 🔍 **Incident Response & Digital Forensics** – Lead comprehensive DFIR investigations using industry-standard tools (Volatility, Autopsy, Splunk)
- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Management** – Identify, prioritize, and remediate security risks using frameworks like NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and OWASP
- 🔐 **Application Security** – Secure code review, threat modeling, and OWASP Top 10 mitigation with full-stack experience (Node.js, React, PostgreSQL)
- 📊 **SIEM & Threat Detection** – Design and tune detection rules, analyze logs, and track incident lifecycles using Splunk and QRadar
- 👥 **Security Awareness** – Translate complex technical findings into actionable insights for executive leadership and non-technical stakeholders

**What Sets Me Apart:**
- ✅ Implemented layered security controls that **stopped recurring malware and account-compromise incidents** across a 30-endpoint remote network over my 16-month tenure
- ✅ Developed accessible security training that **measurably improved user security behavior** and reporting of suspicious activity
- ✅ Led security assessments and remediation for **PCI DSS, GDPR, and PIPEDA compliance**, contributing to organizational certification
- ✅ **Accessibility-integrated security** – Created inclusive incident response procedures (WCAG 2.1 compliant, screen reader compatible)
- ✅ **Full-stack developer + security analyst** – Understand entire software development lifecycle for secure code review and AppSec work
- ✅ **Mission-driven values** – Passionate about open-source, digital privacy, right-to-repair, and sustainable technology
