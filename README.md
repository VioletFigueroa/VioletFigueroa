## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **CompTIA Security+ certified cybersecurity analyst** with hands-on lab training in incident response, digital forensics, and vulnerability assessment through Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. I bring practical IT and security experience from a small business role, plus a full-stack web development background.

**What I Do:**
- 🔍 **Incident Response & Digital Forensics** – Trained in DFIR methodology through 30+ bootcamp labs (Volatility, Autopsy, Wireshark)
- 🛡️ **Vulnerability Management** – Lab experience with OpenVAS scanning, CVE analysis, CVSS scoring, and remediation planning
- 🔐 **Application Security** – Full-stack developer background (Node.js, React, PostgreSQL) with OWASP Top 10 awareness
- 📊 **SIEM & Log Analysis** – Bootcamp training with Splunk and QRadar for alert triage, log correlation, and detection rules
- 👥 **Security Awareness** – Taught basic security practices to a small business team; created accessible documentation

**What Sets Me Apart:**
- ✅ **Practical security experience** – Deployed endpoint protection (Malwarebytes), password management (Bitwarden), and firewall rules for a small assistive-device business
- ✅ Taught basic security hygiene to a non-technical team and created training materials
- ✅ Reviewed **PIPEDA and GDPR** requirements and created privacy policies for an ecommerce business
- ✅ **Accessibility-integrated security** – Experience making security controls work for users of assistive technologies
- ✅ **Full-stack developer + security analyst** – Understand the software development lifecycle for secure code review and AppSec work
- ✅ **Mission-driven values** – Passionate about open-source, digital privacy, right-to-repair, and sustainable technology
