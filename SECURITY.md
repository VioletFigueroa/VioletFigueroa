# Security & Responsible Disclosure

## Disclaimer

All projects in this portfolio are for **educational purposes only**. These repositories demonstrate my learning journey and practical application of cybersecurity concepts in controlled environments.

### Lab Work Verification

All security assessments, forensic investigations, penetration testing, and vulnerability analyses in this portfolio were performed:
- ✅ In **controlled lab environments** (isolated from production systems)
- ✅ With **explicit authorization** (educational coursework or personal lab)
- ✅ Following **ethical guidelines** and security best practices
- ✅ Using **responsible disclosure practices**
- ✅ For **learning and skill development purposes**

### Educational Context

These projects represent:
- Coursework from cybersecurity bootcamp training
- Self-directed security research in lab environments
- Practical application of industry frameworks and standards
- Demonstration of security knowledge and capabilities
- Real-world scenario simulations for learning purposes

None of these projects involved:
- Unauthorized access to systems or networks
- Active exploitation of production environments
- Violation of privacy or legal requirements
- Disclosure of sensitive information

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects:

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue (this would disclose the vulnerability)
2. **Contact me directly** at: [violet@violetfigueroa.com](mailto:violet@violetfigueroa.com)
3. **Include details:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if applicable)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment** of the vulnerability within 1 week
- **Remediation** timeline based on severity
- **Credit** in the fix commit (with your permission)

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Response Time | Patch Time |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Critical | 24 hours | 7 days |
| High | 48 hours | 14 days |
| Medium | 1 week | 30 days |
| Low | 2 weeks | 60 days |
